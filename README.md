# The-Quest
This is the completed C# desktop application from lab 2 in Head First C#, 3rd edition.  After completing
the original lab, I modified my code to turn the app from a slowly sequential "turn-based" game into an
action game - the enemies movements are continuous and goverened by probability and a timer control.

Like the wizard in the game,  there is no waiting for life.
